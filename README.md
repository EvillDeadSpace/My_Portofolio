Greetings All,

I'm Amar Tubic and currently, I'm occupied with creating my portfolio through this project. There are still some minor errors that need to be corrected in the text. This project helped me acquire proficiency in React tools such as cards and also in 3D JavaScript effects like stars. I have also been sharpening my skills in Tailwind CSS. During the course of this project, I got to explore and use Framer Motion for the first time and had an enjoyable and helpful experience. These are some of the technologies that I used.
